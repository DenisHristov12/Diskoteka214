# Diskoteka 214

Diskoteka 214 is a fun and dynamic project that began as a joke inspired by my dorm room, Room 214, where the best parties happen. What started as a lighthearted tribute to our spirited gatherings has evolved into my biggest project I have ever worked on.
It is a dynamic web application designed for booking and managing events. It features a comprehensive user interface for attendees to view upcoming events and book their spots, as well as an admin panel for managing the events.
